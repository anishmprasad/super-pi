A complete test with 10 nodes, and with SENDFAILURE = 80.
Expect: The coordinator should enter a dead mode if its Survival rate < SENDFAILURE.
				A LEADERDEAD will be detected by the workers, and eletions will be called after.
				After 15 second, the coordinator will return alive in 30 seconds and the next round AYA-IAA probing starts.
Result: SUCCEED!
